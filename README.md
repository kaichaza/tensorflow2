# tensorflow2
Jupyter notebooks using TF2
This is an example running TF2 using the example code from Aurélien Géron's "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow", 2nd Edition, O'Reilly, 2019
In this example I run through the std fashion MNIST example using TF2, then plot a confusion matrix and pull some misclassified examples using code from the Udemy course by the Lazy Programmer.
